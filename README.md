FirebaseFirestore is used for securely storing and managing chat data. Additionally, the app leverages Socket.IO for real-time messaging, ensuring instant communication. Key features include a chat list, detailed chat view, and options to block or report individuals, promoting a safe and pleasant chatting environment..
